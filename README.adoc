=== Calculation of hours:
* 52 weeks
* 2 weeks sick leave per person
* 5 persons
* 8 hours per person per week

==== Formula
(52 weeks - (2 weeks ill * 5 persons)) * 8 hours per week * 5 persons

==== Result
( 52 - ( 2 * 5 )) * 8 * 5 = 1680

==== Conclusion
In 52 school weeks there are 1680 working hours for 5 persons if everyone is ill for 2 weeks.
Otherwise there would be 2080 working hours.
